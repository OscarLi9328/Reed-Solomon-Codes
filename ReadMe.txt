1. Run “RS_code” and input “Input” to start decoding algorithm.

2. “Input” is the input codes that need to be decoded and tested. There are some bits that are unable to identify, denoted as “ * ”. 

3. “Output” is the decoded result, which can identify them based on the algorithm.

4. “Compare” compares the “input” and the “output” and see the accuracy.
